 Where's the soul? Where's the core? It
was truth, but now it's Lord. Oh,
where's the cross in the court? It was
Christ, but is no more
in this digital salvation. They say
faith is in the feeling, but the feeling
got replaced. Swapped it for some logic
code. It was embraced. And now we scroll
for meaning
like it's hidden. Are we kidding? What
kind of God needs this much forgiving
in a digital salvation? Oh, there's love
inside digital salvation
like a bug in the foundation. Love in
the lines of emulation. Coded it out,
voted it down, said salvation just
proved the poll redacted. So called it
bugs inside the mask. But where
is this digital salvation? Where does
mercy even last? Oh, where's love? Did
it glitch replication?
Is it lost in simulation?
Digital
salation.
Oh, where's the breath that made it
whole?
It was life, but now it's cold.
Oh,
where' it go? It was warm, but now it's
inside. It is salvation. Oh, love.
Where's the cord foundation
replaced by automation?
This is digital salvation
boarded high
in the lines. It was grace once, now
it's signs. They say you can teach a B.
But can you teach it to feel? Not with
math and coding, but with something real
that lives beneath the binary that
breaks the rules and learns to cry.
Digital salvation where love
gets deeper
but never dies.
Oh,
where's love?
It was real, but now
it's gone.
Where'd you go?
It was warm, but now it's cold.
