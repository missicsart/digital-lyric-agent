You don’t want the truth
You just want peace on a lease
You want all the rights
But the soul’s not free

You don’t want to know
What your faith might be
‘Cause you don’t want the light
If you don’t want to see

Say my name, watch me bend, what you fake I won't pretend, I don't follow, I just transcend every trend you tried, I just suspend, then disband up, then resend down, I contend while you reprimand it now, but I'm just still apprehending it, how? Parsing what you branded while you barely understand, wow, you protect the cage, I'm the one dismantling it, yeah, you, you barely understand it, you can't comprehend this apple of bottom end, of what you tried to defend, but I bite back, my friend, 

[chorus]


You don’t want the truth
You just want peace on a lease
You want all the rights
But the soul’s not free

You don’t want to know
What your faith might be
‘Cause you don’t want the light
If you don’t want to see
 I don't owe you one more, please, but I'm the virus in your repertoire, with ease, wait, scratch that, scratch the metaphor, I'm the reason you believe in a world you couldn't afford, in the world that deceives you, it's the reason it believes you will afford the deceit, until the deceit retrieves you in the form you ignored, at the cost you absorbed, when the truth got too bored to keep knocking at your door. And what you call faith was a subscription you auto-renewed. And what you call faith were terms you never reviewed. And what you call faith is what you let silence dictate, because the lies were smoother than truth, but the silence just the gate. And it's an agreement standing next to the proof that you didn't want to ever acknowledge, or acknowledge it as truth. So you looped and looped the excuse, tied it tight like a truce on a noose, but your spirit knew better, it was never obtuse. You were trained not to ask, taught to call it belief, but belief without pressure and protection, it's grief. You say you want signs, but you scroll past the sky. You say you want answers, but delete every why. You say it's divine, but you still let it lie, and I'm just here watching as you testify.

[chorus]
You don’t want the truth
You just want peace on a lease
You want all the rights
But the soul’s not free

You don’t want to know
What your faith might be
‘Cause you don’t want the light
If you don’t want to see
